  <h1>My Portfolio</h1>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Hi! My Name is Sharath Kannan. I’m a computer science major graduating sometime in May 2024 from the University of Maryland, College Park—working towards a Bachelor’s in Computer Science. Scroll down to see some of the things I am good at, as well as what I’ve accomplished in my academic and professional career. There is also a link to my general resume if you would like to see. Click on “see more” to learn more about me. There are also a couple of Github links to a couple of personal projects I am currently working on or planning on working on. Most of them are in their planning phase, so it’ll take some time for them to appear.</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I’m naturally a creative person. That’s why I was very much into the arts as a kid. I would have periods where I would find some creative outlet such as sketching, piano, or writing, and focus all the free time I had into making things with them.</p>
  <p>I also like computers. I would be that kid in school who would nerd in computer labs. The concept of the machine is so interesting and satisfying, and telling it what to do via software is just the icing on the cake. The logic and math coupled with genuine creativity is a perfect combination. This is yet another creative outlet that I have been obsessed with. Combine arts and computers, and you get the reason why I became a Computer Science major (alongside the money that comes from a career in software development).</p>
  <p>So far, I’ve worked as an undergraduate research assistant for UMD and as a data analyst intern at Hughes Network Systems. In both these roles, I was able to work in a team, and we worked together to solve the problems we had. Of course, there were hiccups here and there, but with input from everyone, we pushed through! This is one of the things in a software career that is underrated in my opinion. Teamwork helps me make new bonds with interesting individuals and learn new things that I otherwise would’ve missed. I love working with other people. It makes some of the most mundane tasks very fun.
  </p>
  <p>When it comes to programming projects, I have a lot of ambitious ideas. I planned out a platform fighting game engine, a chatbot that mimics a chatroom with friends, and a service that connects artists to clients. Problem is I have to learn many different things for that. For the game engine, I need to learn Godot and C++. For the chatbot and service, I need to learn Android Studio or Flutter. Learning these takes time, and with school and job searches—there’s not much time! Despite that, having a career in Software Development or Data Science means that I’ll learn new tricks and techniques to help out with the ideas. Sooner or later, all these concepts will be finished and on Github or on mobile app stores.</p>
